## Voltorp Filp (3/11/2018)

Long time ago, I played Pokemon Heart Gold on Nintendo DS. There was a mini game called Voltorp Filp. It was pretty interesting so I decided to create my own Voltorp Filp using Javascript.

In that time, I was studying in petroleum engineering degree. I had never been coding too much. This might be my very first project that introduces Javascipt and makes me love programing.

## Rules

1. There is 25 cards with hidden values [0,1,2,3] with randomly distributed.
2. Every columns and rows informs total scores (with black text) and number of zeros (red text).
3. Rules are simple, your score will be calculated by the product of faced-up cards (Meaning that once you filped a 0-value card, you lost).
4. If you filped all non-zero-value card, you win.

Refactor the code after working in IT-related field for one year.
