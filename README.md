## Voltorp Filp (3/11/2018)

Long time ago, I played Pokemon Heart Gold on Nintendo DS. There was a mini game called Voltorp Filp. It was pretty interesting so I decided to create my own Voltorp Filp using Javascript.

In that time, I was studying in petroleum engineering degree. I had never been coding too much. This might be my very first project that makes me love programing.

## Rules

1. There is 25 cards with hidden values [0,1,2,3] with randomly distributed
2. Rules are simple, your score will be calculated by the product of faced-up cards (Meaning that once you filped a 0-value card, you lost)
3. Every columns and rows informs total scores (with black text) and number of zeros (red text)
